        <h1>About Me</h1>
        <p>
            Hello! Welcome to totallyBSsimracing! My name is Billy, and I am an avid motorsport and sim racing fan. 
        </p>
        <p>
            The main purpose of this website is to display my sim racing results from iRacing in a public fashion. You see, iRacing, a sim racing PC game, is 
            a membership only game. All of my race results are visable to me and the other members of iRacing, but non-members are unable to view those race 
            results. I thought it would be a fun idea to grab all of my results from iRacing's API to display for the world!
        </p>

            Also, I am growing in my skills and knowledge as a software developer, and this project helps me along the way in my growth.
